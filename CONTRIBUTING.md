## Issue reporting

Please do not open issues to ask questions about the game. In need of an answer from a developper, please contact us via discord.

Please avoid reporting knows issues. If it has already been reported and the issue is still open, please post in the existing thread instead of opening a new one.
<br>To make it easier for us to solve the different issues, you are expected to follow our issue template if applicable.

Here are some good guidelines
 * Please include as many details as possible. 
 If you are reporting a bug, a good report should allow us to narrow the source of the bug to fix it quickly. 
 Good ways to do so is to post the actions required to reproduce the bug, what you were doing at the time, and post log reports. 
 If the bug isn't reliably triggerable, please specify at wich rate it occurs and what you could be doing when it triggers, even if it seems unrelated.
 * Don't forget to include the expected behavior, as it might be an unclear UI issue.
 * Include screenshots if possible
 * If the problem is performance related (high cpu/memory usage), please include usage reports and a clear description of what you expected. 
 * Use a descriptive and short title that describes the issue well. if it's a bug, include [BUG] in the issue title.
